# USA States guessing game!

This game is built in Python, and the main objective is to name all 50 states in the USA.
This program was built using the turtle module to allow for a visual interface.

To install this project on your machine, clone this repository on your terminal.

This program has 3 files:
-main.py = is where the program runs and the code is written;
-"blank_states_img.gif" = Contain the map of the USA where you will guess the names;
-"50_states.csv" = A CSV file containing all the states and the correct location on the map.

To start the game, just run the main.py, and a new window will open with the game.
After you start your guess, the score will be updated to allow the user to know how many states they have correctly guessed.
After you achieve the 50 states, the game will automatically close.
The exit at any moment; just write "end", and the program will stop.

I hope you enjoy the game and have fun!
